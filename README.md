Storing code for the [Kaggle Santa Gift Matching Competition.](https://www.kaggle.com/c/santa-gift-matching)

The code is currently just a scorer after the scoring function given.

The files `tinymt32.c` and `tinymt32.h` are taken form TinyMT. I claim no credit (or blame) for those file. Thank you to the authors of MT and TinyMT.

To compile this there is a `Makefile` available. Just type `make`. However you do need the datafiles from Kaggle. Simply download and save in the same directory as these source files, the datafiles called: `child_wishlist.csv` and `gift_goodkids.csv`. (They may be zipped, so you should unzip them, of course).

So here we begin....
